AI-Based Secured Voting System with Blockchain-Mined Data Storage
Project Description
This project is an innovative web application designed to revolutionize the voting process by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Blockchain Technology. It aims to provide a secure, transparent, and efficient e-voting system that ensures voter anonymity, data integrity, and accessibility. The system leverages face detection and recognition algorithms for voter authentication and blockchain technology for secure data storage, eliminating risks of data tampering or hacking.
The project was developed as part of the Bachelor of Engineering degree in Computer Science and Engineering at Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology.
