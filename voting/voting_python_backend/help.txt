 6hthis is face recognition folder 
here you need to collect face data, train them and recognize the face 

1.first you need to enroll your face 
this will collect your face 30 
and save your id and name in database
the 30 face images will be saved in dataset according to id
note --> there should a unknown dataset images

to run this code -- 
give your id and name

2. you have to encode the face encodings 
this will locate face points and return them

#note 
before running this code delete the existing file in output file

to run this code --> python encode_faces.py 
it will generate a encodings.pickle file in output

3. then we have to train the encodings.pickle 

to run the code --> python train_model.py 
it will generate a two pickle file named recognize and le in output


now you have finshed generating a face regn model 

4. we can now recognize the enrolled faces

to run the code -- > python recognition.py
